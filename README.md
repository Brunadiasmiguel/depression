# Project: Depression / Suicide rates

## Overview

The goal of this project was to collect data from suicides rates and interpreting different types of visualizations as well as statistical analysis. 

## Datasets

- Suicidal rates
- Depression rates
- unemployment rates

## Initial hipoteses

- "Does GDP as a correlation for depression/suicidal rates?"
- "Does Human Development Index as a correlation for depression/suicidal rates?"
- "Does unemployment have an effect suicidal rates/depression?"
- "Does urbanization effects suicidal/depression rates?"
- "Does Life ladder as an effect on suicidal/depression rates?"
- "Does gender gap between male/female as any correlation with depression gap?"
- "Does unemployment gap as any correlation with male suicidal rates?"
- "Does education level as any correlation with depression/suicidal rates?" 



## Data Workflow

* Research for possible data sources
* Create a new repo on GitHub
* Think on the file structure
* Merge and clean the Data from the the different datasets
* Ploting results Globally, per year, per country
* Create a model for countries some countries
* Make a presentation


## Problems encountered

* finding clean data
* merging data
* data containing a lot of missing values, that limits our possible regression models
* finding correlation for the initial hipoteses
* dataset with a lot categorical data, hard two make sense of all the variables
* making sense of the data and finding an acceptabel regression
