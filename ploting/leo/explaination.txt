# there is a high correlation between life satisfaction level (life_ladder) 
    # and gdp per capita / human development index(hdi_undp)

# there is also a high correlation between human development index 
    # and life satisfaction / gdp per capita

# the strongest correlation is between human development index / gdp per capita 

# there is no significant correlation between percentage of people suffering depression and following values:
    # (human development index, life satisfaction, gdp per capita)

# conclusion: depression seems universal, not correlated with development index or gdp per capita

# there are three clusters, next lets try to find out which country belongs to which cluster

# we look at two clusters, both have high gdp per capita, but differing by people suffering from depression

# no real conclusion can be drawn. the only hypothesis I can come up with is people in

# traditional conservative countries seem less likely to suffer from depression or less likely
